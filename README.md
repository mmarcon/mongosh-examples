# `mongosh` examples

`mongosh` is the new [MongoDB Shell](https://www.mongodb.com/products/shell).

This repository is a collection of scripts that showcase the different features of `mongosh` intended to
provide a starting point for writing scripts for the shell to addres the most common use cases.

Because `mongosh` is a powerful, Node.js-based scripting environment, some of the scripts in this repository
take advantage of the huge ecosytem of npm packages to enhance the functionality of the shell. Note that having
`Node.js` installed **is not** a prerequisite for running `mongosh` in general.

However, some of the scripts in this repository require some npm packages to be installed and to install them
the best way is to have Node.js installed.
